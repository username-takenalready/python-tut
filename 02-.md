# Day 1 -- Python Basics

Today we'll talk about the basics of python.

## The print() function
This is first code written in python ever, ever:
```python
# Anyone may freely copy this code
#-------------------------------------
print("Hello world")
#-------------------------------------
# It prints hello world
```

The `print()` **function** is used to send output in the **console**, not printing something on the paper!

But you may ask:
> What is a function?  
> And what is console?

A **console** is where the return of code sends to developers. You can also type **commands** there. [^1]

And a **function** is like a call to Python, to let Python do some work.  
We input **arguments** (often referred as "args" in short [^2]) into functions to let Python knows more about what it should do.

This is how a function looks:
```python
function(**kwargs)
```

This is how to use `print()` function:

print(*content*)

Beware of the *content* kwarg, you **must use `"`** at the start and end of argument input! But why? You'll know later.

## User input
We've just learned print() function, but how to ask user about his/her name?

There is a simple way to do it, use the `input()` function!

An input function looks like this:
input(*content*)

Same as `print()`, also remember to use `""` at the start and end of the *content* kwarg.

Also, to print the input, put it inside the `print()`!

## Usage
Now we learned `print()` and `input()`, but let's use them!


Use the function you learned to fix the code.

```python
print ("Hello! What is your name?)
Print("Hello,","input("\n")")
```

```python
print("Hello! What is your name?") # no need to use spaces & forgot " at the end
print("Hello,",input("\n")) # functions don't need "" & use small letters
```

## Practice

Help Sam write a code that meet the following requirements:  

1. Prints the username inputted
2. Have a greeting when ran
3. Less than 5 lines

[^1]: You can only type one line code in console each time
[^2]: This is the name in most of the time
