# Day 2 -- Data Types and Operators
Yesterday we talked about the basic functions of Python. Now we're going to talk about **why we need to use** `"` ?  
To be honest, this is **data type** problems.

## Word Bank
**Data Type** -- The type of any python data  
**Operator** -- Symbols or functions that you put in middle of two datas (or 3, or maybe 1)

## Data Type
If you read the word bank, you should know what is a data type. Well, lemme explain more details. A **data type** is the actual type of any objects in python such as `1` , `"hello"` or `{abc: "def"}` (this is more difficult and we'll learn later). This is a  python data type list:
| Data Type | Full Name | Defination | Example
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| int | Integer | Whole Numbers. | 1
| str | String | Simple Text with "". | "hello"
| float | Floating-point number | Real Numbers. Must have decimal point. | 3.14
| bool | Boolean | Logic Value. Only two values of this type -- true and false. | true

We need to use quotes because print() and input() uses string as kwarg. And if we don't use quotes then python will think it's a **variable**.

Also, we can change types by these functions:

| Function | Defination | Usage
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| int() | Convert String to Interger | int("3")
| str() | Convert object, interger , floating or boolean into String | str(0)

Beware, unlike JavaScript, python **will not** automatically change data type.

## Operators
An **operator** is symbol than you put between one/two/three values, but what can they do? There are tons of operators and they have different usage.

#### Calculation Operators

| Operators | Defination | Usage | Value
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| x + y | Adds up x and y | 10 + 5 | 15
| x - y | Subtract x by y | 10 - 5 | 5
| x * y | Multiply x by y | 10 * 5 | 50
| x / y | Divide x by y | 10 / 5 | 2
| x % y | Get the remain of x / y | 10 % 5 | 0
| x ** y | The y power of x | 10 ** 5 | 100000
| int(x) | Convert string x to integer | int("0") | 0

#### String Operators
| Operators | Defination | Usage | Value
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| x + y | Connect two strings | "abc" + "def" | "abcdef"
| fx | Change string x to template string | f"1" | \<template string\>
| str(x) | Change interger, object or floating to string | str({"a":"b"}) | '{"a":"b"}'

#### Compare Operators

| Operators | Defination | Usage | Value
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| x == y | If x is **equal** to y, return **true**. Or else return false. | 0 == 1 | false
| x != y | If x is **equal** to y, return **false**. Or else return true. | 0 != 1 | true
| x > y | If x is **bigger** than y, return **true**. Or else return false. | 1 > 1 | false
| x < y | If x is **smaller** than y, return **true**. Or else return false. | 1 < 2 | true
| x >= y | If x is **smaller** than y, return **false**. Or else return true. | 2 >= 2 | true
| x <= y | If x is **bigger** than y, return **false**. Or else return true. | 3 <= 3 | true

#### Boolean Operators

| Operators | Defination | Usage | Value
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| x and y | If x & y are **both true**, return true. Or else return false. | 1 < 2 and 3 < 4 | true
| x or y | If x & y are **both false**, return false. Or else return true. | 3 > 2 or 2 == 3 | true
| not x | If x is true, return false. Or else return true. | not 0 < 3 | false

Be sure to use these **operators** correctly and memorize their usages!

## Usage
Can you catch all mistakes in this code?

```python
print(Say hi!)

PRINT("1+1=","1"+"1")
print("3-2=",3_2)
print("56×14=",56×14)
Print("333／58=",333／58,"and it's remain is,",333 % 58)
print("Now you know about math!')
p rint("Time to ask,  What is your name?')
print "Hello,",input("\n")
```

<details> <summary> Solution (No Peeking) </summary>

```python
print("Say hi!") # you need ""

print("1+1=",1+1) # use int or it will become 11! & use small letters
print("3-2=",3-2) # wrong operator
print("56×14=",56*14) # use * operator
print("333／58=",333/58,"and it's remain is,",333 % 58) # no chinese operators! & use small letters
print("Now you know about math!") # You can't use both ' and "
print("Time to ask, What is your name?") # You can't use both ' and " & grammar mistake
print("Hello,",input("\n")) # bracket needed
```

## Practice
Today we don't have an exercise. Happy Python!
