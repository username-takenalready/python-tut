# Introduction to Tutorial

**Python** is a popular coding language. This tutorial will teach you about python.

## Why Python?

Instead of JavaScript, C or Java, python has the **least difficulty** in all of these languages. Also, python can do something other language can't do.

In the 2021 EEEE Spectrum of the best coding language, python got full marks and got first place. Here is why it gets first place.

### Python vs JavaScript

**Better than JavaScript:**  
Python is easier to learn than JavaScript. Also, Python has a  bigger module network and can do many things that are such impossible to JavaScript. For example, making AI.

**Worse than JavaScript:**  
Python cannot be used to customize websites, and thats the main usage of JavaScript. Also, JavaScript is normally used to customize computer or phones because it is more compatible to devices and have more usage on developing apps.

### Python vs Java

**Better than Java:**  
Python and Java are both text-outputed languages, but Python is such easier to learn. Python also does not have to decode while running, but Java does.

**Worse than Java:**  
Python module network is smaller than Java, because more coding professionals uses Java. This lets Java to do more things, such as making games or making softwares.

### Python vs C

**Better than C:**  
Python is more easier than C to learn. Also, python can do more things than C because Python has bigger module network. Python can make AIs , games and drawings but C can't. Also, python doesn't have to decode while running, but C does.

**Worse than C:**  
C is better to make machines or robots because C has more codes than Python in default. Also, more machines is compatible to C than Python. And C# -- a type of C language -- can be used to make websites like JavaScript, but Python can't.

## How Tutorial Works

We will use quotes to tag codes like this:
```cpp
// this is C++ code
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

string x = "bruh";
// example code
cout << "example code";
cout << x;
```

We will use **bold** for new words or points.

In **functions**, we uses *italic* text to mark required elements, and [*italic with blanket*] to mark optional elements, like this:

> function(*required*,[*optional*])

That's the end of introduce, happy python!
