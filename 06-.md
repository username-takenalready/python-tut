# Day 5 -- Classes, Objects and System Controls

Yesterday we talked about logical functions, but don't you feel messed about the console?

Now we can operate the operation system just by Python!

## Word Bank
**Module** - python code addon  
**OS** - short form of Operation System  
**Arrays** - objects that stores multiple values  
**List** - a list that stores multiple objects  
**Tuple** - simillar as list, but unchangable  
**Set** - simillar as tuple, but unordered  
**Dictionary** - simillar as list, but have custom keys  

## The OS Module
The os **module** can be imported with:

> import *module_name*

Example:
```python
import os
```

The os moudle can do many, many things!

Here are useful os attributes/functions: (All of them needs `os.` at the start!)

| Function | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| system(*command*) | Run *command* in the shell |
| getcwd() | Get the current file location |
| path.isfile(*path*) | Check if the file *path* exists
| path.isdir(*path*) | Check if the location *path* exists
| path.split(*path*) | Split *path* into (*location*,*file*)

Remember **you need basic knowledge of shell language** to use `system()`!

| Attribute | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| name | Get your system type |
| sep | Get the split symbol of the file locations of the system |
| linesep | Get the linefeed syntax of the system |

If you need help of basic shell language, here are some of them:

| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| clear | Clear the console |
| kill | End the code instantly (Not recommended) |
| echo | Same as `print()`

For `kill`, add a space and add a "1" after it.
For `echo`, enter the content that you want to enter after a space.

## Arrays
In day 2 and day 3 we barely talked about objects. Now it's time to know more!

Here are the list of **arrays**:

| Type | Changable | Ordered | Allows Same Keys | Allows Same Values | Have Customizable Keys | Syntax | Format |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| List | Yes | Yes | N/A | Yes | No | *list name*[*index*] | [*values*]
| Tuple | No | Yes | N/A | Yes | No | *tuple name*[*index*] | (*values*)
| Set | Partly (Can add and remove) | No | N/A | No (Ignored) | No | *set name* | {*values*}
| Dictionary | Yes | Yes (Python 3.7 or newer)[^1] | No (Overwrite) | Yes | Yes | *dictionary name*[*key*] | {*key*:*value*...}

For how to calculate index, please read day 3.

These are the list of function for arrays:
| Type | Attach value at the end | Insert item at specific index/key | Delete an item at the end | Remove an item at specific index/key | Remove an item at specific name | Change Value | Extend array | Remove the whole array (Make it undefined)
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| List | *list*.append(*value*) | *list*.insert(*index*,*value*) | *list*.pop() | *list*.pop(*index*) | *list*.remove(*value*) | *list[*index*]* = *value* | *list*.extend(*another list*) | del *list*
| Tuples | **Tuples are unchangeable.** ||||||| del *tuple*
| Sets | *set*.add(*value*) | **Sets are unordered.** | *set*.pop() |  | *set*.discard(*value*) | **Sets are partly unchangable.** | *set*.update(*another array*) | del *set*
| Dictionary | **Dictionary indexes are not used for adding values.** | *dict*[*key*] = *value* | *dict*.popitem() | *dict*.pop(*key*) | **N/A** | **Same as creating a key** | **N/A** | del *dict*

In this list, the **list**,**tuple**,**set** or **dict** stand for the array you want to use the function on.

After knowing about **arrays**, now we can learn about how to create an object.

But first, we need to learn about **classes**.

## Classes

In python, a **class** is simillar to an object, because it has differrent **attributes** to call.

You can create a class with:
```python
class NameOfThisClass:
  Variables = "TheValue"

```

Now, time to learn anew function called `__init__`, which is a **built-in function**[^2].

However, since you require a bit of function knowledge, we will continue on day 6!


## Practice
Since you almost have the complete knowledge of basic python, today's pratice is... create **a clicker game**!

For someone who don't know, a clicker game is a type of game that you **click** to collect something (money, diamonds... etc), then use the thigs to like buy boosts or power-ups, then finally win the game.

Here are the requirements:
1. At least 120 lines of code
2. At least 10 boosts/ power-ups
3. At least 1 way to win the game
4. At least 5 minutes to win the game
5. Must include at least 3 arrays in code
6. Must include at least 5 console clears in code

[^1]: In Python 3.6 or older, dictionaries are unordered.
[^2]: Functions that you don't have to define and you can use immediately. Like `print()` is a built-in function.
