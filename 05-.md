# Day 4 -- Logic and Exceptions
Yesterday we talked about variables and constants, now you can almost make a game with your knowledge! Now you only need more knowledge of logic and debugging.

## Word Bank
**Exceptions** -- Errors when code is ran that is unexpected to happen  
**Debug** -- Removing **bugs** from the code  
**Bug** -- Code Errors

## If and else and elif
Logical Code is an important element in game. **If, else and elif** are useful logical code that can detect a condititon.

This is the format of If and else:
> if *condition*:  
> ⠀⠀*action*  
> elif *condition*:  
> ⠀⠀*action*  
> else:  
> ⠀⠀*action*

You need to put **boolean operator** (explained in day 2) to the condition file.

**Note:** Elif and Else are optional.

This is an example:
```python
score = -100

if score == -100:
  print("Ur such a noob")
elif score == 0:
  print("ZERO")
else:
  pass

if 3 + 2 == 5:
  print("yes")
elif 1 - 2 == -1:
  print("...")

```
**Fun Fact:** `pass` is a line of code that does nothing. It is usually used for removing code scan errors.

## Exceptions
Although you debug a lot, there's still can be **unexpected errors** that could happen with nothing wrong in the code! Such as Network error, ram error... etc.

Now, we need to have a code to automatically handle the exceptions. Then the **except** function will help!

The format is like this:
> try:
> ⠀⠀...
> except:
> ⠀⠀...

**Bonus 1:** You can use `except Exception as e` to replace except, then you can use `e` as a variable that saves the error in the code!

**Bonus 2:** You can use **finally:** (optional) to add a code that will run anyway.

Example:
```python

try:
  print("hello")
except Exception as e:
  print("an error occurred")
  print("error",":",e)
finally:
  print("code ended")

```

## Practice
Now, you have even further knowledge of Python! Here is what you need to do:

Try to create a math test using what you learned today.

Requirements:

1. At least 10 Question
2. Uses if-else to check your answer
3. Shows your final result
