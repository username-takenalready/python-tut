# Day 3 -- Variables, Constants and Notes

Yesterday we learned about data types, now today we're learning about **variables**.

## Word Bank
**Variables** -- Stores value that **can be** changed  
**Constants** -- Stored value that **can't be** changed

## Variables
Before we start, you might have experienced using vars[^1] in **block coding**[^2], in Python it's almost *the same*. Please read the word bank to find out what is a variable.

To define a variable, simply use 
> *variable name* =(or other operators) *value*

Just like this: (It will define the "Author" variable and set it's value to "Impasta")
```python 
author = "Impasta"
```
Beware about names of a variable, it has some rules!

--------
**Rule 1**  
No Numbers at the beginning of name. Capital Letters are allowed but we usually start with small letters.

**Rule 2**  
Only capital/small letter or numbers/underscopes in name, spaces aren't allowed. Use underscopes instead!

**Rule 3**  
Capital and Small Letters are different. Like "author" and "Author" are two different vars.

--------------

You can use other **variable operators** that aren't `=`.

These are the frequently used variable operators:


| Operator  | Defination | Example
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| = | Straight Replace. Can assign another variable. (any type) | a = 1
| += | Adds value to original value. Can assign another variable. (int and float) | a += b
| -= | Subtracts value to original value. Can assign another variable. (int and float) | a -= 69 * 10
| *= | Multiplies value to original value. Can assign another variable. (int and float) | b *= c
| /= | Divides value to original value. Can assign another variable. (int and float) | d /= 10 + e
| %= | Replace with the remain of the orignial value divide by value. Can assign another variable. (int)| f %= g - 1

These are the useful operators.

## Constants
If you read the word bank, then you'll know that a **constant** stores values that can't be changed, there **aren't any** straight ways to create a constant in Python, but we can simply use **tuples** to achieve this.

**Object Tuple** format like this:

> ([*first value*],[*second value*],[*third value*]...)

**Note:** You can create blank lists.

To assign a blank list, you have to:
> *tuple name* = *tuple*

And to access its value, like this:
> *tuple name*[*index*]

Or access full tuple (Will **return**[^3] a tuple object)

> *tuple name*

An **index** is calculated as below:  
(*position of value* - 1)

Meaning if want to access 69 in `amongus = ("69","sus","ur mom")` you need to use `amongus[0]`.

This is an example:

```python
welcome = ("Hello","Hi","Sussy baka")
constants = ("Nope")

print(welcome[0])
print(welcome[2])
abcd = input("Well well well")
if abcd != "well":
   print(constants[0])

```
**As you can see,** we can put `input()` function into a variable to **repeatedly** access it.

## Practice
Design your very own short story using Python, and meet the following requirements:

1. Must have at least 3 variables
2. Must have at least 1 input
3. More than 10 lines
